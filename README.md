# MD5 Hashing Algorithm Implementation
 This repository is intended to provide an implementation of the MD5 specification as outlined in
 [RFC 1321](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt). This project should be suitable to use as a teaching aide to explain
 the algorithm to software development students or those with a basic understanding of programming and computer science
 concepts. This MD5 implementation is written is C. A good working of knowledge of C will make the code easier to follow
 although it is not strictly required as each section should be explain and design choices and implementation details.
